# Calculator Case

This project is a simple yet interactive **calculator application**, built with HTML, plain CSS, and TypeScript.
It performs basic arithmetic operations and includes a fun Love Calculator as a hidden extra feature :)

## Features

Users can:

- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using on-screen buttons.
- Test love compatibility between two names using the dropdown love calculator.

## Installation and Setup

**Step 1:** **Clone the repository**

Inside the terminal, run:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/username/CalculatorProject.git>
cd CalculatorProject
npm install
```

*Replace `username` with your actual GitHub username*

**Step 2:** **Compile the TypeScript code**

Make sure your in the project folder:

```bash
cd CalculatorProject
```

Then run:

```bash
npx tsc
```

*The command `npx tsc` runs the TypeScript compiler, which checks for type errors and compiles `.ts` files into `.js` files that browsers can understand.*

## Run the project with Live Server (VS Code)

**Step 1:** **Install Live Server extension**

*(Skip this step if already installed)*

- Open the Extensions panel in VS Code.
- Search for **Live Server** by *Ritwick Dey*.
- Click **Install**.

**Step 2:** **Launch the application**

- In the Explorer, right-click on `index.html`.
- Choose **"Open with Live Server"**.

YEEEY! The calculator should now open in your browser.
